# Dairy_Management_System
Dairy Management Sytem is based on the local observation of how a local dairy manages their records of customer and the milk
produced, it was important for a system which can replace the whole paper based system into electronic one with a dyanmic database
so that data can be stored and managed easily while able to access any record in no time wasted.
Based on Java NetBeans with XAMPP for phpmyadmin to use database.
Java JFrame for easy User Interface.
